EDINA: Oh!

Edina turns off the alarm.

SAFFRON: Thank you!

Edina blows a raspberry. She begins to groan.

EDINA: Panic attack, panic attack, panic attack!

Edina guzzles wine from the nightstand. Footsteps approach in the hall and Edina rustles to hide the bottle beneath her duvet.

SAFFY: It’s 9:30. Your car’s been waiting outside for an hour.

Footsteps recede. Edina pulls back the duvet to reveal a spilled wine bottle and soiled bed linen. Edina opens the window blinds and is blinded by the light streaming in. Cut to...

INT. EDINA’S HOLLAND PARK HOME -- KITCHEN

EDINA: Health, health, health, darling!
Edina opens the refrigerator and coughs.

SAFFY: Washing machine.

EDINA: That's absolutely right, sweetie.

SAFFY: Feeling great I expect this morning, are you?

EDINA: Fabulous, darling.

Edina points to the bottles on the kitchen table.

EDINA: Patsy can put it away can't she, sweetie? Oh God! Stop looking at me like that, sweetie! What do I have to do to convince you I’ve given up drinking? I had one bloody drink, sweetie! Are you accusing me of something?

SAFFY: Have you looked in the mirror this morning? Your eye bags are ruched.

EDINA: What are you eating there?

SAFFY: Toast.

EDINA: What is that on that toast?

SAFFY: It's honey, Mother.

EDINA: Honey? That's not honey, that's my bloody royal jelly moisturiser, sweetie. Oh, God, you are eating £300 worth of royal jelly, darling. It's been hand-squished out of a bee's backside. And not any old bloody bee, but the bloody Gucci of bees, darling. This is the stuff...Jackie Stallone would kill for this, darling.
Edina scrapes the moisturiser off the toast.

EDINA: That's better. Make me a cup of coffee, darling.

SAFFY: You know where it is, make it yourself.

EDINA: I don't know where it bloody is, do I?

SAFFY: Please don't swear.

EDINA: Sweetie, make mum a cup of coffee. You're so clever and you know where everything is darling, don't you? I think it's marvellous the way you know where everything is. You're marvellous.

SAFFY: Flattery won't turn me into your servant. The coffee is in front of you. Pick up a spoon, put coffee in cup, pour on boiling water.

EDINA: Yes, Yes. Scald hands, get third-degree burns, scream in agony Do you really want that on your conscience this morning?

SAFFY: Alright

EDINA: Thank you, sweetheart. No, not instant, darling, not instant. Grind some beans, for God's sake. Instant coffee is just old beans that have been cremated. I don't want them. I want them entire with life force today.

Saffy pours the beans into the grinder.

EDINA: Could you not pull that face while you grind? I don't really want to drink a cup full of your anger. Anyway, I shouldn't be drinking coffee. I shouldn't be bloody drinking coffee I don't want any coffee, throw it away. I don't want any bloody coffee! I just wanted some fennel twig tea or something. (Gasping) Look at the time, sweetie, I should be in the office! Sweetie, sweetie, sweetie, sweetie! Tell them my car hasn't arrived, there's traffic door-to- door and I'm not well! I’m not well!

SAFFY: Hello? My mother's sitting here in her dressing gown ...

EDINA: It's just me, darling. I know, "dressing gown", she knows nothing about fashion. Now listen, sweetie. I'm literally out of the door when my bloody car turns up, and I'm managing to keep a lid on things this end alright? I know you can manage that end, Bubble darling, alright? I'm chanting as we speak. Bye-bye, darling. (Edina replaces phone’s antennae.) You're not a Buddhist, darling, you wouldn't understand about that.

SAFFY: Mum, you did it for a week, which admittedly for you is a record.

EDINA: It's not a fad, darling. It's not like crystals.

Edina starts chanting gibberish.

SAFFY: Please, stop it!

EDINA: Sweetie, you wouldn't say that if you knew how much we owe to my chanting, darling. This house wouldn't be here, darling. I chanted for this gorgeous house! I chanted to be successful and believe in myself. (chanting) Please let me make some more money so I can buy Saffron books and a car. Ding, ding, ding, ding! In Buddhist obviously, not in English, when I do it properly.

SAFFY: What is it, some sort of cosmic cash machine?

EDINA: Oh God! Could you try not being so cynical today? Today I need just a little bit of bloody support.

SAFFY: Why is today such a panic, anyway? It's only a fashion show and you've had six months to prepare it. Why is everything always so hysterical? All you've got to do is play a bit of music, turn on the lights, get some people who have thrown up everything they've ever eaten and send them down a catwalk. Greater feats have been achieved in less time and with less fuss.

EDINA: Not quite with it, darling, are you?

SAFFY: Major motion pictures are made, huge concerts are put on in stadiums I mean for God's sake, 500,000 troops were mobilised in the Gulf, a war fought and won in less time, and without everyone involved having a nervous breakdown and being sent flowers. It cannot be that difficult.

EDINA: Darling, every troop didn't have to contain Yasmin Le Bon. The generals didn't require "big hugs" after every manoeuvre, and the whole operation did not have to be coordinated to rap and Japanese avant-garde pipe music. Because you know, darling, I think if it had, the outcome might have been rather different, don't you? Hmm ??? Now, if you'll excuse me I'm going to go and get dressed. Forgot to ring Chukhani. He was going to channel a colour for me today.

Edina frantically dials numbers on the phone.

EDINA: Chukhani, it's Edina. Green. Thank you, darling. Don't look at me like that. There's more to it.

SAFFY: Of course, there is. The bill.

EDINA: Sweetie, sweetie. He doesn't just choose the colour; listen, cause you might learn something now. He doesn't just choose the colour himself, darling. It is related to who I was in a previous existence.

SAFFY: And who was it you were in a previous life? I suppose you were the Elizabeth Taylor of the Ming dynasty?

EDINA: Well close, yes.

SAFFY: So how come you've ended up just a mad, fat, old cow?

EDINA: Will you stop saying that word "fat"? Stop it, now! Stop it! I know you're only saying it to annoy me. Aren't you, darling?

SAFFY: No, I'm saying it because it's true.

EDINA: Oh God, oh God, oh God, oh God.

SAFFY: What happened, then?

EDINA: Why do you have to pick on everything I do? All I want are a few little things, a few little pleasures, a few little crutches to help me get through life, darling.

SAFFY: Get through? Mum, you've absolved yourself of responsibility. You live from self-induced crisis to self-induced crisis. Someone does your hair, someone chooses what you wear, someone does your brain, someone tells you what to eat, and three times a week someone sticks a hose up your bum and flushes it all out of you.

EDINA: It's called colonic irrigation, darling. It's not to be sniffed at.

SAFFY: Why can't you just go to the toilet like normal people?

EDINA: Is that what you really want me to be darling, normal? Some boring, old, normal old toilet goer? Hmmm ??? "Where's Mummy?". "She's on the toilet." "But I want to go to somewhere interesting and meet exciting people." "Well she can't take you because she's on the bloody toilet.” "Well anybody can go to the toilet,” darling, they say.

SAFFY: Well they, obviously, they haven't seen you drunk .

EDINA: What do you mean by that remark? Can I just say thank you, bloody thank you, so stop doing that now! Thank you so bloody much for giving me such a lot of support on this bloody important day. Darling, a lot of daughters might have offered to come with me and help, but no, not you. You've probably got something rather interesting to listen to on Radio 4 have you? Or some new exhibit of test tubes at the Science Museum to go and see. It doesn't matter, I'll just go on my own. There's a little party afterwards,you know darling, but i'll probably just go on my own to that as well, shall I?

Edina pouts behind Saffy’s back.

SAFFY: No.

EDINA: Oh come on, darling. Sweetheart.

SAFFY: It's your drama, you act in it. I won't be your accessory. "What should I wear the daughter with the Dior?” “Oh look at Edina isn't she marvellous and she's got a family, I don't know how she does it. How clever!"

EDINA: Time of the month, darling?

SAFFY: No.

EDINA: Just thought you looked as if you were retaining a little water down here, that’s all. Darling, if you want to lose weight sweetie I've got some marvellous pills upstairs darling. You just pee it out overnight. Alright. You're not seeing your father tonight are you darling?

SAFFY: No.

EDINA: Good.

SAFFY: Go and get dressed.

EDINA: Darling. Darling, look at Mummy. Look at Mummy, sweetie. Do I need surgery, darling?

SAFFY: Yes.

EDINA: Alright.

SAFFY: Get your mouth sewn up.

EDINA: I'm still here, darling. I heard that.

Edina walks up the basement stairs toward the ground floor. Cut to...

INT. EDINA’S HOLLAND PARK HOME -- RECEPTION AREA

EDINA: Yes, well I pay you to interpret my dreams, so can't you at least find a hidden depth? Well, I'm not willing to believe I'm simply that obvious. And if you're a bloody psychic psychologist, how come I'm always having to call you? Oh just stuff it! Saffy darling, I'm off, but I won't see you later, because you don't love me enough darling. Lacroix, sweetie! It's alright, isn't it? It's a bit tight maybe, but it's alright, isn't it? You know, people will think, "Wow, it's a Lacroix!" OK? I just can't find anything to go with it that's all.

SAFFY: Maybe I can throw up on something for you? Oh I see, someone already has.

EDINA: Jean Muir. Bloody door! It will be my car. Sweetie, it will be my car.

PATSY: Darling.

EDINA: Pats, darling.

PATSY: Sweetie, your car's here. I thought I might scrounge a coffee.

EDINA: Well darling, I can't I'm in a dreadful rush, I can't. Saff is here, though, alright?

PATSY: What are you wearing, Eddy?

EDINA: Lacroix.

PATSY: It's fabulous.

EDINA: Good, thank you.

SAFFY: Patsy could go with you, Mother.

EDINA: Yes, Pats, why don't you come with me in the car? We'll talk in the car. Alright, darling? Bye-bye, sweetie, darling bye bye. Have a little haircut, have a little bob.

SAFFY: Don't be...

EDINA: What darling?

SAFFY: Don't be late.

EDINA: Alright, sweetie.

SAFFY: Or drunk.

The next scene is outside in the street outside Edina’s car. Cut to...

INT. EDINA’S CAR SERVICE

EDINA: Darling, stop me drinking today. Saff has threatened to leave home again.

PATSY: Darling, you don't drink.

EDINA: Look i know I'm not a drinker, but you know what she's like, I mean.

PATSY: A pig.

EDINA: God, I must ring in and tell them I'm coming.

PATSY: What will you drink if you stop drinking?

EDINA: I shall drink water. It's a mixer, Patsy. We have it with whisky. You know what it's like. You've given up drinking before.

PATSY: Worst eight hours of my life.

EDINA: Right, it's me. I'm on my way in. Everything's completely under control this end, how is it with you? Lights, models, guest list? Just do your best, darling. I'm rushing. Bye.

PATSY: Are you going straight to the office?

EDINA: Yes.

PATSY: Past Harvey Nich's?

EDINA: No, Pats.

PATSY: Could we? Well, it is nearly lunch-time.

EDINA: 10:30, Patsy.

PATSY: Hmm??

EDINA: Well look we can do Harvey Nichols quickly and then we'll pick up some lunch and just take it into the office. I think it would look better.

PATSY: Whatever. But darling remember it's your company. You're the boss, you can do what you want. Don't let them pressure you.

EDINA: I'll just ring and tell them. Shall I?

PATSY: You'll kill yourself the way you go on.

EDINA: Yes, i'll ring them later. Darling, you will come to the show tonight, won't you? Saffy's refused you know and I need just a little bit of support.

PATSY: Well, of course you do and of course I will.

EDINA: Deserted by son and daughter.

PATSY: Where is Serge? Where is Serge?

EDINA: Potholing with his university, I don't want to talk about it.

PATSY: I sometimes wonder what the point of having children is if they're not going to turn up to your launches? Did you tell them how important it was for you darling?

EDINA: Did I tell them? I faxed the bloody dean, the bollocky halls of residence and the buggery mountain rescue. What more can I do?

PATSY: Nothing, and you shouldn't have to. I mean, look at you. You've been a fantastic mother. You've let them ruin your figure.Your stomach's stretched beyond recognition, you've got tits down to your knees, and what for, for godsake? For a potholer who's worn nothing but a purple nylon tracksuit and a Gazza t-shirt for the past two years. Cut the cord, darling. Left here if we're going to Harvey Nich's.

EDINA: Left!

PATSY: We're going to Sanford’s for lunch and then we're going shopping. (Patsy removes a pregnancy test from her purse.) Eddy, can I borrow your phone? Thanks.

EXT. EDINA’S PR OFFICE

EDINA: All right. I'm glad you're with me Pats, because otherwise I wouldn't use that car. II wouldn't use that huge car pouring out petrol fumes and pollution like that, but you know there were three people in that car. Three people in that car!

PATSY: Oh shut up, Eddy. No one can hear you.

EDINA: Darling, it's me. I'm coming into the office now. I'm coming through the door. right i'm here, darling.

INT. EDINA’S PR OFFICE

EDINA: Don't panic, don't panic, I'm here. Right, Bubble. Let's get things moving. Sweetie, darling, I'm sorry i'm so late.

BUBBLE: I think everything's just about done.

PATSY: I told you things would manage without you, darling.

EDINA: Right. Now, Bubble, did all the models turn up?

BUBBLE: Yeah every single one.

EDINA: Good, good.

BUBBLE: Except one.

EDINA: Except one? You're not going to tell me it's Yasmin Le Bon, darling?

BUBBLE: No.

EDINA: Thank God!

BUBBLE: No, sorry, yeah. Yasmin Le Bon is ill.

EDINA: Oh my buggery bollocks. Why the bloody hell didn't you tell me earlier?

BUBBLE: Well, her husband's just phoned and said "Simon Le Bon", which I thought was really amusing.

EDINA: Amusing, darling? Yeah.

BUBBLE: Very modern of him to take his wife's name.

EDINA: Bubble, sweetie.

BUBBLE: I phoned round and I think I may have found a replacement.

EDINA : Good, good. Who?

BUBBLE: Betty Boo.

EDINA: Shit.

BUBBLE: Some of the designers aren't happy, but I said you'd speak to them.

EDINA: This is all your fault, Patsy.

PATSY: It's all fixable.

EDINA: Yes, you're right. Come on, how is the celebrity and VIP list looking?

BUBBLE: Good, I think. But you know me, I don't know anybody.

EDINA: Come on, darling. Come on, darling! Just tell me about Joan Collins, Stefanie Powers, Paloma Picasso, Charlotte Rampling, Catherine Deneuve. Give me some names, darling.

BUBBLE: So far?

EDINA: So far.

BUBBLE: So far Sinitta and Anne Robinson definite. We're still chasing Anneka Rice. Gave up on Norma Major.

EDINA: Just get me my phone book now, would you darling? Get me my phone book. I mean Princess Di has to have somebody to sit next to. You don't get Princess Di...

BUBBLE: Anne, Anne. Princess Anne.

EDINA: As well as is it darling?

BUBBLE: Instead of. Only. Possibly with daughter.

EDINA: Why, why?

BUBBLE: There was a bit of a mix-up. I didn't make the call, but she's very game and a really nice person.

EDINA: I wouldn't care if she was Mother bloody Teresa! It doesn't matter for our purposes. What we need is a princess with a press following and a designer dress on her back!

PATSY: Not someone who looks like she runs up her own.

BUBBLE: Well her people were a bit cagey about which designer she favoured.

PATSY: The only label she wears is "drip dry".

EDINA: Come on, come on, come on, darling! Let's take stock now. We've got three hours.

PATSY: Darling, finish the beaujolais and walk away from it.

EDINA: Shut up now, Patsy.

PATSY: Right, I'm off. Are we eating?

EDINA: Yes sort of. French, Italian, whatever you like.

PATSY: Oh darling no one's eating that sort of food any more. But there's a fabulous new Japanese in Mayfair. Everything is raw. Anything which has a pulse is lunch.

EDINA: Alright, darling, whatever, whatever.

BUBBLE: The magazine called for you, Patsy. They need some decisions about this month's cover.

PATSY: Oh really! Whatever can they need to know? I mean it's the same every month, a model in make-up with a vacant look on her face. Well I might drop in on the way home. See you later Eddy, I'll leave the bottle.

EDINA: No don't leave the bottle, Patsy. I need a clear head for the next three hours darling.

PATSY: Do you want some coke?

EDINA: No, sweetie no. No, shh!

PATSY: Save it 'till later. Good luck, darling. Have you got something I can pee into? I want to do another test before I go.

EDINA: Bloody hell, Patsy! Wash it this time, will you? Anyway,darling who was it you were with last night?

PATSY: He was just a windscreen washer I picked up at the traffic lights. Buns so tight he was bouncing off the walls.

EDINA: Bye, Pats. Darling, bye.

PATSY: Bye-bye, sweetheart.

EDINA: Bye, darling. Goodbye, sweetie.

PATSY: Darling, you are a fabulous, wonderful individual.

EDINA: Thank you.

PATSY: And remember, I've known you longer than your daughter and anything you do is alright by me. You know you're my best friend, sweetheart. Can I take your car?

EDINA: Sweetie! Well, as long as it's back by six, I'm alright.

PATSY: Bye, Eddy. Thanks, darling.

EDINA: Right. Now, Bubble, I want a list of every PR company, every record company in the country, I want a copy of "Who's Who?" and the latest edition of Hello! Magazine. Let's get "celebritied" up! Come on! Bubble, I want four huge video screens down either side of the catwalk. I want to flash up pictures of sad, but beautiful children, happy gay couples, slogans like "World Health", "No Pollution", "Fashion Cares". Alright darling? And print up thousands of new invitations on green, totally recycled paper, and cab them around to everybody. Now, now! Now, darling. Now, sweetie! Now, now!

Some time passes.

EDINA: get on Princess Anne's people tell her that everybody there will be mentally ill. Tell her we'll sponsor her to wear a designer dress ok and make sure she realises that if she doesn't those little children won't get anything. Press release. Free champagne reception. Get on to Moet and Chandon. Tell them it's for charity. Get on to Joan Collins. Tell her it's free champagne. Look, darling. I don't want to wear this, sweetie. I want to look completely happening and unbiased. No, sweetie. just get me something from every collection. Alright darling? Come on! Come on! Leave that, darling, leave that.

INT. EDINA’S FASHION SHOW -- BACKSTAGE

EDINA: Come On! Quick, quick, quick, come on! Come on! Darling, they loved it.

EDINA: Harper's, Tatler, English Vogue, American Vogue, French Vogue, bloody-Aby-bloody-ssinian Vogue, Jeff Banks and Selina Scott couldn't even get a ticket, darling. I'm going down in history Pats, as the woman that put Princess Anne in a Vivienne Westwood basque. People weren't even looking at what was happening on the catwalk.

PATSY: Good job, really darling. Betty Boo and Danii Minogue did their best, but frankly...

EDINA: Cheers, anyway.

PATSY: Cheers.

EDINA: Pats?

PATSY: Darling.

EDINA: Are we keeping these two?

PATSY: No, I thought we'd get a couple of different ones at the party.

INT. EDINA’S PR OFFICE

EDINA: If I squat down, I'll piss myself.

PATSY: Let's go away, Eddy.

EDINA: No, sweetie! When, darling, when?

PATSY: Now. Let's go on holiday.

EDINA: I can't, sweetie. I promised Saff I'd get home tonight. Don't start making me go on holiday, Pats!

PATSY: Darling, you need a holiday. How long has she been around for? She's been around forever.

EDINA: 16 she is, Pats.

PATSY: 16 years you've had her. 16 years! Get rid of her!

EDINA: I can't!

PATSY: Montserrat, I want to go to Montserrat.

EDINA: Look at me, Patsy. You're looking at a huge success tonight.

PATSY: I know, darling, I know.

EDINA: Career and all this. I've got fabulous kids who adore me. (Edina breaks into tears.) I just moved myself there, Pats. I'm sorry. What was I saying, Patsy? You were just going to tell me about their bastard, bastard bloody fathers! God, I married the two biggest shits in the world, didn't I? Hmmm??? Do you know I don't know why it went wrong with Justin, because we just adored each other, you know?

PATSY: He's gay.

EDINA: No, Patsy, that wasn't the reason, was it? Hmmm?

PATSY: Oh let's go on holiday.

EDINA: Stop it, stop it! Stop it now! Look, she mustn't know I've had a drink, darling. She mustn't know I've had a drink.

PATSY: Darling, you're only slightly drunk.

EDINA: I can't let her know I've had a drink.

PATSY: Come on, sweetie.

EDINA: Go on, sweetie, go on. She'll never know, will she, darling?

PATSY: She's not your bloody mother!

EDINA: She's not my bloody mother! Mother never knew, did she, Pats? Remember?

MOTHER: Hello, Edwina dear. Good concert? Why don't you come in and tell us all about it? Your father and I are still up.

EDINA: I'm very tired, actually.

MOTHER: Come on, dear. Your father would love to see you.

EDINA: Where am I?

MOTHER: Hi. Here she is. Where was the concert this time, dear? Eel Pie Island again, was it? And who was it? Anyone we should have heard of? The Beatles, The Stones, The Rolling Who? You look a bit dizzy, dear. Are you OK? Is that cider I can smell on your breath?

EXT. EDINA’S HOLLAND PARK HOME

PATSY: No, she's not. It's alright, darling, she's not here. She's not here, darling.

Saffy appears in the doorway, looking foreboding.

PATSY: Oh God! The pig's here. Come on, sweetie. Come on, sweetheart. Alright, darling? Alright, Eddy? Alright, sweetheart. Go, Vinny. Goodnight, Eddy, darling.

Taxi drives away.

CLOSING CREDIT SEQUENCE

SAFFY: Stay still! Do you want to sleep in your clothes? Thank you.

EDINA: Yes, I do. Where's my joint box? You've stolen it again.

SAFFY: What do you want that for?

EDINA: Where is it, darling? Oh sweetie. Help Mummy now, help Mummy.

SAFFY: Do you want a glass of water?

INT. EDINA’S HOLLAND PARK HOME -- KITCHEN

SAFFY: Oh hang on a moment. Mum, it's the Betty Ford Clinic.

EDINA: What do they want?

SAFFY: They say they are confirming the booking for four weeks from next Monday.

EDINA: Sweetie I think it's the only way. Don't you, darling? I'm going to swallow my pride and do it, if that's alright by you. You've been very good to me. Thank you darling.

SAFFY : Well done!

EDINA: Thank you, sweetie.

Saffy walks up the basement stairs.

EDINA: Thanks, Pats.
EDINA: Yes, yes, yes, yes. It'll be alright with a bit of jewellery. Oh God, this is stupid. No, no, no, no! I've never been this heavy. There's not enough room on my bones for that sort of weight.

Toilet flushes.

EDINA: No, no, no, no. Those are real gold, they must weigh more than that. God!

INT. EDINA’S HOLLAND PARK RESIDENCE -- KITCHEN

SAFFY: Oh dear!

EDINA: Morning, sweetie. I'm only going to wear orange from now on. Religious purposes.

SAFFY: You've been getting dressed for three hours and still look like a bloated citrus fruit.
EDINA: Sweetie, it's a very healing colour, a very positive colour. I'm getting rid of all my other clothes.

SAFFY: Is that really the best you could come up with?

EDINA: Oh God! Well, only this and the dreaded kaftan fitted. Well, I say fitted. It was filled to capacity. I mean, all my clothes have got stretchmarks, darling. Honestly, you wouldn't believe how much I weigh.

SAFFY: I would.

EDINA: I know I don't look hugely overweight

SAFFY: You do.

EDINA: But what I saw in the mirror shocked me. Barbara Bush with no clothes on. I don't believe it.

SAFFY: Who did you expect?

EDINA: Marisa Berenson, of course.

SAFFY: Who?

EDINA: I have only ever seen Marisa Berenson. Sometimes Cher. Pre-knife.

SAFFY: Do you want a cup of tea?

EDINA: No, coffee, black. I shouldn't drink milk. Oh God, why am I so fat?
SAFFY: You're not so fat.

EDINA: I am! Why?

SAFFY: Well to start, you eat too much, drink too much and take no exercise.

EDINA: Darling, darling, please. It's far more likely to be an allergy to something, isn't it? You know, buildup of toxins, or something, or a hormone imbalance, isn't it? Hmm? And also, sweetie, I've got a very heavy aura. Do you know that? That's why animals love me, darling.

SAFFY: They just see you as something to hibernate in. I take it you want a chocolate croissant?

EDINA: "Pain au chocolat" we call it in this house, and no thanks, I won't I'll just nibble a corner of yours. There's only one thing to be done. (Edina dials the phone) It's just the chocolate I have to avoid in those. I'm alright with the pastry. (To phone) Can I speak to Dr Jackson. It's Edina.

SAFFY: Mum!

EDINA: Philip, darling! It's Eddy. Look, can I have a few more of those pills I had last time? I want to lose a stone. Two weeks. But it must be years since I had them last, isn't it? But they were just palpitations, for God's sake! Are you telling me I can't have them? What’s the point of having a private doctor if he won't do what you want? Listen! Please! I want them to kill me! Philip? Can you believe he's not going to give them to me!

SAFFY: Good. You can't just take lots of speed to lose weight.

EDINA: You can, darling. He treats royalty, believe me. Anyway, who wouldn't suffer a minor coronary for that degree of weight loss.

SAFFY: Mum, all you have to do is eat less and take a bit of exercise.

EDINA: Sweetie, if it was that easy everyone would be doing it. Anyway, I don't know what you mean. I do take exercise!

SAFFY: You get out of bed, it ends there.

EDINA: I know what I’ll do, I'll wait 'til Patsy gets here and phone her doctor. He'll do anything. Otherwise I'll go to the Chinese clinic.

SAFFY: Oh here we go!

EDINA: Sweetie, it's not what I eat or how much I eat, it's those things in here. This fridge is filled with crap. Just filled with crap. Look at this! I should only be eating organic food, food with the dirt still on it, darling. Throw out all the food in this fridge. It's revolting. I should JUST be eating green and white holistic food, shouldn't I, sweetie? I shouldn't be eating... Oh that's still got some in it. I shouldn't be eating all this, should I, darling? Anyway, first I'm going to go on a fast. It's not the sort of fast you're thinking of. It's a special fast.

SAFFY: Sort of an "eating a lot" sort of fast?

EDINA: Just try and help me.

SAFFY: What can I say?

EDINA: Darling, just try to be a little less Western in your thinking, if you can. You realise, of course, that in Zen terms everything in the universe is just molecules, don't you? Ying and Yong, Ping and Pong. Hmm? You know that, darling? Those are my molecules, those are your little clump of molecules over there. I mean in real terms, there's no difference between me and the coffee, me and the the table, me and a tree or me and Madonna, for God's sake!

SAFFY: Except you have a fatter bottom.

EDINA: Shut up!

SAFFY: What do you want me to say? It doesn't matter to me that you haven't seen your navel in 25 years, or that you can wear your stomach as a kilt. Just tell me you're happy.

EDINA: How can I be happy with this great bulk hanging off the skeleton? I can't

SAFFY: Alright, do something about it, but do something sensible.

EDINA: Can you not use that word in this house, please?

SAFFY: You're not ill, you don't have a disease

EDINA: As far as I know.

SAFFY: You're not menopausal.

EDINA: No, I'm still very much menstrual, thank you!

SAFFY: You've been tested for everything under the sun, so you're not allergic.

EDINA: Wrong, jellyfish!

SAFFY: There's more of your blood in test:tubes than in your veins. You've tried every fad-drug and fad-diet that's ever existed. More money's gone into your quest for "Twiggyness" than goes in aid to most Third World nations and somehow, Mum, somehow, you're still two stone overweight.

EDINA: One stone!

SAFFY: Mum!

EDINA: Well, for my height.

SAFFY: How tall are you?

EDINA: Six foot.

PATSY: Morning, Eddy.

EDINA: Just stand there, Pats I'm going to lift my shirt. I want an honest opinion.

PATSY: Surgery. Liposuction on the stomach and hips, bum lift, tit lift, lose a rib. This is Georgy. Say hello, Georgy.

GEORGY: Hi.

PATSY: Shall we have some coffee? Georgy?

GEORGY:I don't know I'd better not, I've got to be at the gym in a few minutes, but thanks anyway, ladies.

PATSY: Girls, Georgy, we're girls.

GEORGY: Goodbye, then.

PATSY: Don't pump too much iron at that gym of yours, sweetie.

GEORGY: I'll see you later.

PATSY: What do you think?

EDINA: He's nice of a type, Pats.

SAFFY: A toilet-trained gorilla.

PATSY: Nobody asked you.

SAFFY: You have nothing in common. You can't have anything to talk about.

EDINA: She doesn't want someone to talk to.

PATSY: I've got you to talk to.

EDINA: Exactly. No one blinks an eye if an older man goes out with a young girl bimbo, do they? What's really sick Listen, Patsy. What's really sick, is when a non:bimbo girl goes out with a really old man.

SAFFY: Mum, what is this world you live in? What does "bimbo" and "non:bimbo" mean?

EDINA: The real world, darling.

PATSY: Remember when I went out with Ferruzi?

EDINA: This man was 55 years old, for God's sake.

PATSY: The only thing that got him up in the night was his bladder.

Edina does not respond to the joke.

Did you get it, Ed? Did you get it? The only thing he got "up" for was to have a slash.

Still nothing from Edina.

Remind me not to tell that one again when I'm sober.

SAFFY: Sober? Chance would be a fine thing.

PATSY: Right, Eddy. So, body crisis? Yes.

EDINA: Are you sure about surgery?

PATSY: It's a viable option nowadays. Everyone's doing it.

EDINA: My face?

PATSY: It's up to you.

EDINA: Euch! I am a little "Germaine Greer-ish", aren't I?

SAFFY: I think she's great.

EDINA: She was once cool, but Mr. Gravity's been very unkind to that woman.

PATSY: So, face? Yes.

SAFFY: No!

EDINA: Darling, look at those wrinkles.

SAFFY: That's age, that's what happens.

EDINA: Sweetie, this is premature ageing. Therefore I can legitimately have it corrected.

SAFFY: You look fine.

EDINA: I could look better, sweetie.

PATSY: Time and money is all it takes, Ed.

EDINA: You have to be scientific about it.

PATSY: Right. Have a quick flick through those and find someone you want to look like.

EDINA: Right.

SAFFY: That'll be Dad.

EDINA: Oh what's he doing here?

SAFFY: He's come to see me.

EDINA: Ugh.

Saffy goes up the kitchen stairs toward the ground floor.

EDINA: Oh. You're right, I do need a bit of inspiration. I could go out and buy a lot of clothes two sizes too small, but I've done that before. What’s the recovery time on liposuction?

PATSY: Hours.

Justin comes down the stairs.

JUSTIN: Hello, there.

PATSY: Justin!

JUSTIN: Sweetheart!

EDINA: I wasn't informed you were coming.

JUSTIN: I thought you'd be at work. I've come to see my daughter.

EDINA: She's my daughter, too, you know!

JUSTIN: I'll never be able to forget that!

EDINA: Oliver's not with you, I hope.

SAFFY: Stop it, Mum!

EDINA: Sweetie! We are your parents having a civilised conversation. Butt out! How are things with Oliver?

JUSTIN: Very good, actually.

EDINA: Oh good. I'm so glad, I'm very pleased!

PATSY: Steady, Eddy.

SAFFY: How you could have chosen to live with an evil, vicious, pot-bellied, ugly dwarf is beyond me!

JUSTIN: Your mother and I were happy for a time, you know.

EDINA: God! You turn up here without so much as a present for me.

SAFFY: No, Dad, not this time!

EDINA: You sit there in your antiques shop and not so much as a present or a thought for me, : who's here bringing up your daughter.

JUSTIN: OK, OK. In the shop there's this little Indian turban box. Silver:inlaid top with beautiful handpainted scenes around the sides. : A thousand pounds.

EDINA: Oh darling! Thank you!

JUSTIN: Ah! Table, 18th century, walnut, turned legs, Iovely in the dining room, darling.

PATSY: Thank you, Justin.

JUSTIN: OK.

PATSY: Come on, Ed. The car's here, let's go.

SAFFY: Stop compensating her. It's been 10 years.

EDINA: Bye, darling.

PATSY: Driving in?

EDINA: What do you think I should do? Fly? That's not a bad idea.

SAFFY: I just find it strange. I can't understand how someone who's been into everything for the past 20 years, not one trend has passed her by, yet she has conveniently dodged ever having to take any exercise. That fad was missed by a mile.

EDINA: Stop showing off to your father like this! Can I just explain about that for a second, darling? Help me here, Justin. In the '60s, we were too stoned to jog.

PATSY: In the '70s, we had platform shoes.

EDINA: That high. And in the '80s, darling What happened in the '80s?

JUSTIN: Brain cells destroyed in the '60s. She can't remember. The Age of the Punk.

EDINA: Yes, punk, darling. We were too busy putting pins through our noses

SAFFY: But you were too old to be a punk, weren't you?

EDINA: Darling, I was a punk.

SAFFY: I know.

PATSY: Oh! Don't let her torture you. She ruined your figure. She's the one who turned you into this potato that we see before us.

JUSTIN: Now, now, now! That's unfair. I liked you when you were heavier. You were more cuddly.

EDINA: I'm going to throw up.

JUSTIN: I mean tough really tough.

PATSY: Let's go.

EDINA: We'll go on public transport, Pats

PATSY: Are you mad? I've got nothing to wear on public transport.

EDINA: I won't have my daughter think she's so great because she can use public transport, Anybody can use public transport, darling!

SAFFY: I know. That's the point.

EDINA: Come on, Pats I'll go and get that map thing I always use. You know, the A to Street Map thing:book. Come on!

EXT. EDINA’S PR OFFICE

EDINA: On account.I mean, it's public and it's transport, Of course it is. You don't have to travel on rat-infested sewer trains to be using public transport,

PATSY: That would be ridiculous.

EDINA: Do you think I can get a heli pad in here? Wide enough?

PATSY: You'd have to move the pots.

EDINA: Bubble, I'm coming into the office. Move the pots from outside. Right.

INT. EDINA’S PR OFFICE

EDINA: Right, I'm here, I'm here. Don't panic. Don't panic. Is everything under control?

BUBBLE: Yes, everything is perfectly under control.

EDINA: Good. I'm sorry I'm so late. I had to do a spot of clothes shopping along the way. Now is there anything I should look at?

BUBBLE: Yes, a few of them whatchacallems have come through.

EDINA: What?

BUBBLE: Paper comes out.

EDINA: What paper?

BUBBLE: Very important, urgent paper.

EDINA: What? Tell me, tell me.

BUBBLE: The paper from the answering machine.

EDINA: Fax?

BUBBLE: Messages, letters, the lot. It comes and it comes. Anyway, them. I've managed to get a couple of them down. I copied them onto my pad.

EDINA: Let's have a look. "We are being saved by English Heritage". What does that mean?

BUBBLE: Where?

EDINA: Here, "saved".

BUBBLE: No, "sued".

EDINA: Only four letters out, that's alright. Why are we being sued?

BUBBLE: On that last fashion shoot someone moved a couple of rocks.

PATSY: Moved a couple of old rocks? My God.

EDINA: Stonehenge, Pats

PATSY: So? They should be glad for the publicity.

EDINA: Exactly. Send that one to my lawyers. Now "Penny called from LA". Penny who?

BUBBLE: It'll come to me. It's only urgent-ish. She's coming over in a week or two. She wanted to talk about a shop. Yes. She wanted to sell you some things.

EDINA: My shop. I'm opening a shop, remember, Bubble?

BUBBLE: Ah.

EDINA: Mm. I'm opening a shop, Pats.

PATSY: What are you going to sell?

EDINA: Just gorgeous things.

PATSY: Lovely.

EDINA: Gorgeous, tasteful, little gorgeous things.

PATSY: Expensive.

EDINA: Obviously, yes. There'll be presently Anoushka Hempely sorts of things, Chocolates, Garden implements, that sort of thing. I can't find anyone I want to look like. Oh! Oh she's not bad. Who's that?

PATSY: Ivana Trump.

EDINA: She's good, isn't she?

BUBBLE: Do you think so? Looks like a classic bimbo to me. All that terrible blonde hair on top of her head. False tan. She's far too thin. Always pouting. Absolutely no character. The skirt's too short. It's pathetic with older women struggling to look 25. Sorry.

PATSY: I think she's tremendous.

EDINA: You're very thin, aren’t you, Bubble?

PATSY: She's emaciated, like her brain!

BUBBLE: I know, it's awful I can eat as much as I like and I just don't get fatter. I cannot put on weight.

EDINA: How terrible.

BUBBLE: I know. I wish I was more curvy. I wish I had breasts like yours.

EDINA: No, you don't.

BUBBLE: Yes, I do.

EDINA: No, you don't.

BUBBLE: I do! Great, big, large, pendulous breasts. I'd like to fill a bra.

EDINA: No, you wouldn't Just stop saying you do. You don't know what it feels like. You think that just because you feel better with a couple of oranges stuffed down your cups that you know what it feels like. Well, you don't It's hell.

BUBBLE: I don't have to wear a bra.I just stuff the oranges down my vest.

EDINA: Listen, you little bookmark. You know I only employ you because you make me look better, don't you?

BUBBLE: I've remembered what she's called. Penny Caspar-Morse!

Edina collapses onto the ground.

INT. EDINA’S HOLLAND PARK HOME -- BEDROOM

Edina is unconscious and writhing around in bed. Patsy, Saffy and Justin are watching.

EDINA: Penny Caspar is coming and I'm fat! Penny's coming and I'm fat.

BUBBLE: Who is Penny Caspar?

INT. POSH FASHION SHOW PARTY -- FLASHBACK

PENNY: Who's that? Pat Ast? There's the girl who gives the word "hippie" a new meaning. Move over, Mama Cass! Move out of the way, sweetie. You're blocking my light. Is it an eclipse? No, Edwina's in the room. We can cancel Woodstock. They can play on Edwina's behind.

INT. EDINA’S HOLLAND PARK RESIDENCE -- BEDROOM

Edina begins to run in her sleep.

SAFFY: What's she doing? What pills did you give her?

PATSY: Some tranquilisers. Don't question me.

JUSTIN: I think she's sleep-jogging. She did this for three weeks before we got married. She was anxious about her weight. She wanted to get married in hot pants.

BUBBLE: Did she?

JUSTIN: No, knickerbockers.

PATSY: Poor old fat old thing. Look at her, like a beached whale in designer sheets. It can't have been easy for her growing up in our generation. The era of "The Shrimp" and "The Twig". Penny Caspar was "The Stick".What hope did she have?

BUBBLE: What did they call her?

PATSY: Eddy was called "The Shredder" because she ate huge amounts of tissues.

JUSTIN: Whole toilet rolls.

SAFFY: This is pathetic! I mean, she's not even fat.

BUBBLE: And I'm Dolly Parton.

PATSY: You're right, she's desperately unhappy. We've got to help her. I'm going to do something. I won't let her down. I'm going to get her thin so she can face Penny Caspar with some dignity! Damn it! I mean, she means a lot to all of us.Well, she's been a damn good friend to me. We've got to help her. She's got no willpower, she's helpless. We been through a lot together and I'm going to be there for her. Wake up, Eddy. Wake up, damn you! It will be alright, you will damn well be thin. You will damn well be damn thin!

Patsy reads the label on the tranquiliser pills.

PATSY: Oh God! Eddy, don't sleep. We may have to pump her out again.

Everyone grimaces.

INT. EDINA’S HOLLAND PARK HOME -- BATHROOM

GEORGY: OK, let's start with those abdominals and see if we can get that stomach flat.

PATSY: Tomboyish. Go for it, Eddy.

GEORGY: Let's start with 10.

GEORGY: I'll do them as well, yeah? Yeah come on down. I don't want to see a big movement, just enough to get your head and shoulders off the mat.

PATSY: Go for it.

GEORGY: OK, here we go. One.

Edina’s body barely budges as though she aims to do a sit-up.

GEORGY: And one. Feel those muscles pull in. Show me that again. The OK. Now, just scrunch up like that. Just try and get your head and shoulders off the mat.

EDINA: No.

GEORGY: Your head?

EDINA: I can move my eyes.

PATSY: Well done, sweetie.

GEORGY: Good, that's good. Yeah it's a muscle.

EDINA: I feel it here.

EXT. EDINA’S HOLLAND PARK RESIDENCE

0Edina places Sony Walkman headphones into her ears and stumbles down the street, half jogging, half wobbling.

INT. EDINA’S HOLLAND PARK RESIDENCE -- KITCHEN

EDINA: Oh oh, oh. Sweetie!

SAFFY: How far did you get?

EDINA: I went around

SAFFY: You did a circuit?

Edina nods, breathing hard, and points at the ceiling.

MOTHER: Round the living room, dear?

EDINA: No, no, no! I went across Mead Road, round Elgin Place, around the crescent, across the traffic lights, then back.

SAFFY: The end of the road and back?

EDINA: Yes, yes, yes!

SAFFY: Now long have you got left?

EDINA: Four days, darling.

MOTHER: You shouldn't eat so much, little piggy.

EDINA: I am not eating anything! I'm living on air and mung beans.

MOTHER: You've got your grandmother's hips.

EDINA: Thanks to you. Thanks for all the chips and lard and potatoes and white bread and suet pudding covered in treacle I had to eat as a child. You know, the endless cups of sugary tea...

MOTHER: Mr Whippy.

EDINA: Biscuits and chips and meat fried in six inches of animal fat. Thanks to that!

MOTHER: Before we had the deep freeze.

EDINA: God, even then it was the same food, only colder. And do you know, darling, the real problems started, sweetie, because I wasn't even breast-fed.

MOTHER: Don't be ridiculous, dear. It wasn't done in those days, Imagine me having that clamped to my breast.

EDINA: Mmm I want better for you, darling. I don't want you ending up like me with all my complicated, but still rather marvellous hang-ups.

SAFFY: I don't want that.

EDINA: At least you were breast-fed.

SAFFY: Was I? By whom? You told me that your milk dried up, your tubes blocked and nipples dropped off.

EDINA: They did, they did!

SAFFY: So who was I breast-fed by? Not one of the many saggy:titted hippies who lived with us at the time, I hope.

EDINA: Darling, it was a commune. That was the point. Anyway, sweetie, they gave you a good start in life, didn't they? I mean, you're alright, aren't you? Sweetie, you're alright, aren't you?

SAFFY: How many? Which ones?

EDINA: It doesn't matter, they've all died of overdoses since. Anyway Anyway, sweetie, can I just say that at least you're not fat like me. What you two don't seem to realise is that inside of me, inside of me, there's a thin person just screaming to get out.

MOTHER: Just the one, dear?

INT. EDINA’S PR OFFICE

EDINA: Pull, pull!

PATSY: OK, that's it. There, that's as far as they'll go.

EDINA: Push me up. Push, push

BUBBLE: Leggings?

PATSY: No, slacks.

EDINA: Oh dear! I mean, honestly! What am I going to do?

PATSY: How comfortable are you?

EDINA: On a scale of what?

PATSY: Well, childbirth? A 12:pound baby, no anaesthetic and forceps.

EDINA: I could live with it, I could live with it. What do they look like?

PATSY: A zeppelin in a condom, darling. We'll have to think of something else.

BUBBLE: You could get your jaw wired up.

EDINA: No, I've done that. It lasted two hours. My will to speak was too strong. We're still alright.

PATSY: We can go down to the clinic and have lipo as a last resort. Let's just be sensible about this.

EDINA: If Penny gets here on Tuesday.

BUBBLE: Tomorrow.

EDINA: I can lose a few pounds by tuesday.

BUBBLE: Tomorrow.

EDINA: What?

BUBBLE: Tomorrow. Evening.

EDINA: Why are you saying that?

BUBBLE: Because it's true. She rang.

Edina begins to gasp and hyperventilate.

EDINA: Oh no, no, no!

PATSY: I'm phoning the clinic. Emergency liposuction, please. I'll book you in for collagen lips at the same time. I want you to find out how painful it is.

PLASTIC SURGEON: Lips, madam.

EDINA: No more, no more! No! No more, no more, no more!

Edina shrieks, waking herself up.

EDINA: Oh my body. I love you, my body.
Oh God! Oh God! (Edina dials her phone) Pats? Well, is she there? Who are you? Well, what does she look like? Well, turn her over and ask her name. Oh Pats, it is you! Listen, Pats I can't go through with it. I can't. No. Oh alright.

INT. EDINA’S HOLLAND PARK RESIDENCE -- KITCHEN

EDINA: Looking good, feeling great. Looking good, feeling great. Looks alright, doesn't it, sweetie? Covers a bit. Thin ankles, thin ankles. Look at those, darling. Don't just sit over there. Come on, stand up. Mill about here a bit more when she comes. Form a wall here, so she can't see where I end and you begin. Come on.

JUSTIN: You look great.

SAFFY: Dad, shut up.

MOTHER: She looks fine.

EDINA: Keep milling so she doesn't get a clear view.

PATSY: OK, she's here. Eddy, great news.

EDINA: She's fat.

PATSY: No, no, no. Better than that.

EDINA: She's dead!

PATSY: No. She's blind.

EDINA: Oh, retina operation is it, Pen? Of course it is. Darling, sit down. Have another little drinkie. Let bygones be bygones. When I get rid of everyone, we'll have a nice little chat.

EDINA: You took from me the only man I ever really loved. You're a spiteful bitch, Penny Caspar! Morse. Penny Caspar-Morse, now. Now you come back trying to sell your little bits of tat for my shop. My shop! Well, what a comedown! I'm the successful one now, aren't I? I'm rich and happy and I've got a wonderful family and friends.

PENNY: I want you to know I'm no longer coping with this.

EDINA: I don't have to go to a plastic surgeon to keep my body together. No, no, no. I've got my fantastic bone structure. I am thin and gorgeous!

PENNY: Thin? Ha!
EDINA: Come on, wake up! Come on, Bubble, try and concentrate! I've got important information to tell you. I am going to be in France for nearly a whole week, and I'm counting on you to cope. Now, there’s only one thing you have to concentrate on - one thing: the refurbishment of Bettina's apartment.

BUBBLE: The refurbishment of Bettina's apartment.

EDINA: I promised it would be finished this week. When she said "Third World Chic" I was hoping she would stick to it, but it took me hours to get that fly-blown mud hessian for her kitchen walls. There's a nomadic tribe in the Northern African desert that's going to be travelling rather light this winter, thanks to Bettina. When the wood arrives for the kitchen surfaces remember to stamp "Greenpeace Approved" on it.

BUBBLE: "Greenpeace Approved".

EDINA: If the silk for the cushion doesn't arrive, then fax Calcutta and tell them to weave faster. What can they be doing? Squatting inside the room, making chapattis? Poor Bettina. (Mimics French in her mirror) Bonjour. Oui, oui. Also, I'll try and phone you from my mobile, but I'm not sure it'll work from France.

BUBBLE: Or, even if it does, I won’t understand what you’re saying.

EDINA: Oh, darling.

BUBBLE: You do speak French, don't you?

EDINA: Of course I speak French. Someone has been stealing from me!


INT. EDINA’S HOLLAND PARK RESIDENCE -- KITCHEN
Edina thumps down toward the kitchen from the ground floor area.
EDINA (CONT’D): Saffy!

MOTHER : Morning, dear.

EDINA: What are you doing here?

MOTHER: I've come to stay, dear, while you're away to keep Saffron company.

EDINA: No, you're not. Is she, sweetie?

SAFFY: I don't mind.

EDINA: Saffy doesn't want you here cramping her style. She wants a little freedom. She wants to have parties and have boys around and play loud music.

BUBBLE: : And have orgies.

EDINA: Yeah and a bit of snogging. Smash the place up a bit and crash out on the floor.

BUBBLE: : In a pool of sick.

SAFFY: I don't!

EDINA: Why not, darling? Why not try it just once, sweetie?

MOTHER: You're not like your mother in that respect, are you, Saffron? She spent most of her teenage years sitting on a large bean-bag, cigarette in one hand, joss-stick in the other with a large-lipped youth suctioned onto her face.
EDINA: Come here, darling. Come away from that woman. I want to speak to you.

MOTHER: Nice cup of tea. Where would one find the tea bags?

EDINA: We don't have tea bags. We happen to have tea. Come over here, sweetie. I want to talk to you. Something has been stolen from my room.

SAFFY: What?

EDINA: A certain something precious to me.

BUBBLE: Have you seen this pot?

EDINA: Where? What? Oh.

MOTHER: It's a sort of space-age teapot, isn't it, dear? A teapot to boldly go where no teapot has been before to seek out new life forms.

SAFFY: I hid your stash.

EDINA: Where?

SAFFY: Down the toilet.

EDINA: Ah!

MOTHER: What might one use to put the tea in the pot with?
EDINA: A teaspoon, a bloody, buggery teaspoon! Oh!

MOTHER: A bloody, buggery teaspoon. That sounds rather clever. And what did one fill the kettle from? The bloody marvellous tap, I suppose?

EDINA: No, we happen to have a filter here, alright? God, you come around here and make endless bloody fuss. It's my house where I should be able to do what I want. If only people would let me get on with it. So, I have been busted by my own daughter, have I? What am I supposed to do now, sweetie?

SAFFY: What were you planning to do? Slide it into the lining of your handbag, or insert it into some orifice for some dog to sniff at? I can't believe you were taking it with you. I don't mind if you have to have the odd joint at home, in your bedroom.

EDINA: Oh, sweetie, thank you. How kind, darling! It was for personal use. You're allowed it for personal use.

SAFFY: Yes, but they would send you to prison.

EDINA: Not someone like me. Not any more.

SAFFY: Pathetic.

MOTHER: This filtered water boils very fast.

BUBBLE: That's because there's less of it.

MOTHER: Ah.

SAFFY: I mean, they are illegal drugs. You use them like people have after-dinner mints, to round off a meal. You sniff something to make you speedy or smoke to make you jelly-brained. Either way, you end up more boring than you can imagine.

EDINA: That's rich from someone who lives a life that's so boring it would make a battery chicken take up an evening class, sweetie.

SAFFY: Mum, you are supporting a criminal, corrupt, evil system.

MOTHER: Is she insisting on voting Labour again?

EDINA: Oh, shut up!

SAFFY: You're no different to a junkie on the street, to a dealer. As long as people like you go on doing it, giving it a hint of respectability, the evil will continue. Governments will be undermined, countries kept poor, children corrupted, individuals will be killed, intimidated and tortured.

EDINA: God, you've overdosed on John bloody Craven's Newsround again, sweetie!

FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Ça c'est du parfum, madame.

EDINA: Oui.

PATSY: And two champagnes.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Du champagne.

EDINA: Thank you. What's in there?

FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Ca c’est la poubelle, madame.

PATSY: Yeah, we'll have two of those.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Vous desirez des cacahouettes?

PATSY AND EDINA: No.

EDINA: Peanuts!

PATSY: Oi, peanuts! Sullen, stingy, bloody French bitch.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Madame

PATSY: Mademoiselle. Mademoiselle!

EDINA: I'm going to have a healthy week, Pats. I'm not eating and not drinking.

PATSY: Right.

EDINA: I'm just eating fruit. Just eating fruit and not drinking.

PATSY: You can't go to France and not drink. We're staying in the middle of a vineyard. The area alone is 15% proof.

EDINA: Oh well, I'll drink just wine. Eat just fruit, drink just wine and not smoke.

PATSY: That's good. And I'm not having sex.

EDINA: Are you sure, darling?

PATSY: Positive.

EDINA: Alright, then. OK. Are we starting now or when we land?

PATSY: I think I can safely start now.

Seeing an attractive male walking toward the bathroom, Patsy seems to change her mind. She starts gathering her things.

PATSY: No, let's say when we land.

Patsy stalks off toward the occupied bathroom with two bottles of champagne and knocks on the door. Cut to:

WIDE SHOT OF FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE

Edina and Patsy are driving toward their vacation home in France after the flight from England.

EDINA: Look at this. It’s glorious. Wake up, Pats, look at this. Look what you’re missing sweetie.

PATSY: Mm.

EDINA: Hang on, let's cope with this corner.

Some time passes.

PATSY: Oh, it's gorgeous.

EDINA: Look, it's a little town. This is it, isn't it. Look. Wake up, Pats. Is this the house? Oh, God.

More time passes.

PATSY: Eddy, we've been down this road before.

EDINA: That is the same village. We are going backwards.

Edina pulls over to the left side of the road and gets out.

EDINA: Am I on the right side of the road or the wrong side of the road? I can't go on until I'm sure.

PATSY: Keep driving, Eddy. You haven't hit anything yet.

EDINA: This is here. I should be on the right-hand side of the road.

PATSY: Do you want me to drive?

EDINA: Oh, so speaks the woman whose head has been lolling like a bladder on a stick for the best part of the journey. Read the maps, get the maps.

Patsy hands Edina a map.

EDINA: This is Spain. (she looks at a different one) Read the instructions.

PATSY: "Leave airport, turn right" Blah, blah, blah.

EDINA: Right. Now get in, Pats. I shouldn't have gone left, should I? Would left be the same in France? Going back to that bloody airport, or we'll never find it. Oh, God. I hate France, I hate it. ! Oh, God.

EXT. FRENCH VACATION HOME

The car pulls up.

EDINA: Eight hours, Pats, it has taken us. That knocks your idea of wild nightlife in St Tropez on the head, doesn't it, sweetie.

INT. FRENCH VACATION HOME

Edina and Patsy argue noisily.

EDINA: Eight hours, eight bloody hours. If you hadn't...

PATSY: If you read the instructions and didn't go in so many bloody circles we might be ten minutes from St Tropez.

EDINA: I don't think so. The sky lost that comforting orange glow a long way back.

PATSY: Oh, it's gorgeous.

EDINA: After eight hours in that bloody car with you, Patsy, the local pissoir looked rather gorgeous. But this?

PATSY: Oh, shut up, Eddy. We want something to eat and something to drink.

EDINA: Oh, God! To eat, Patsy, I can see four pieces of dried-up pasta and half a packet of French toast which defied eating at the best of times. (panicking) A cockroach, a cockroach, a cockroach! Don't kill it! I'm a Buddhist, I could come back as one of those. Oh!

Edina flails about in front of the cockroach. Patsy kills it with a broom.

PATSY: I think it had a coronary, sweetie.

EDINA: Oh, God! Insects, insects! They followed me, those bloody insects. Insects follow me everywhere, from Tuscany to the Caribbean. Insects, insects, insects! I usually see pictures of glamorous houses in Marrakesh, for God's sake. You don't see spiders scuttling into the corner. You never see a picture of Jane Seymour with a centipede dangling from her bloody tiara! No, they just follow me, they bloody follow me. A mosquito has never bitten you, for God's sake!

PATSY: The last mosquito that bit me had to book in to the Betty Ford Clinic.

EDINA: Exactly! Oh, God, I hate France!

Cut to:

MOTHER: I'm having a little trouble finding the BBC, dear. I flicked through about 15 channels.

SAFFY: You've got it on satellite. Press that one.

MOTHER: No wonder! I kept seeing these Italian housewives taking their bras off. I thought, "This can't be Challenge Anneka. " Can I help myself to a sherry, dear? Oh, or shall I have a Japanese beer? No.

INT. FRENCH VACATION HOME

A clap of thunder and the lights suddenly go out.

EDINA: Pats! Straw Dogs!

PATSY: It's alright. I've got a lighter.

EDINA: That's typical, isn't it, when you go abroad! The slightest suggestion of a thunderstorm and all the bloody lights go out! That's typical, isn't it? Oh, let's all join Europe so the lights can bloody go out everywhere. Sieg heil, the Federal State!

PATSY: Shut up, Eddy! What's the matter with you? You need a joint, we both need a joint.

EDINA: I haven't got any. Saffy flushed all mine, the lot. I thought you had something.

PATSY: I was counting on you. I've only got some coke and some ecstasy.

EDINA: Are you mad? No one's taking that any more.

PATSY: Well, I'm going to bed.

EDINA: Don't just leave me here, stranded! Darling, there's only one candle, sweetie.

The head towards the bedroom.

EDINA: Careful here, we could come across a corpse, or something.

Cut to... The following morning. Edina is wastefully spewing air freshener into the air about their vacation space.

EDINA: I'm very sorry about the bloody ozone layer, but this is a matter of human survival here. Pats, go down to the village. You know what we need.

PATSY: I don't know what we need.

EDINA: Yes, you do, darling! You know, milk and bread and cheese and little French things. Go on.

PATSY: Why don't you go?

EDINA: I'll write it down for you. Hang on. Look, come on, sweetie. Look, we need bread. "Pain." From the bakery. The pa-pa-pa... "painerie".

PATSY: Blancmangerie?

EDINA: And a few little "vejartables" from the "grocerie". A few little things, anyway. Go on, off you go.

PATSY: Look, Eddy, you do it.

EDINA: Oh, no! OK, but you have to call Saffy and Bubble and let them know we're here.

PATSY: I tried. I don't know the code.

EDINA: Isn't it the same as from LA?

PATSY: It doesn't work! Anyway, there isn't a book.

EDINA: We'll just phone the "operateur".

PATSY: And say what?

EDINA : "Ou est le code for... Angleterre. For Londres," for God's sake!

PATSY: I'll do it when you've gone.

EDINA: Oh.

PATSY: Have you got some money, darling?

EDINA: Yes, I've got lots. Well, well, well.

PATSY: Is that enough?

EDINA: That's about 500 pounds. I've got cards. Alright, sweetie. See you later. Oh, God!

There’s a knock at the door.

OLD FRENCHMAN: (Imploring in French) Qu'est-ce que vous faites ici? et puis, qui vous:êtes, vous? Le château est à 400 mètres. Vous ne comprenez pas? Qu'est-ce que vous faites ici?

Patsy desperately tries to communicate for the guy to slither away. Hastily, Patsy hands the man all the cash she in her hand. He takes the rest of the cash from her other hand.

OLD FRENCHMAN (CONT’D): J'espère que vous passerez de bonnes vacances.

Patsy closes the door and starts to gag severely.

EXT. FRENCH VILLAGE

Edina wanders around the little town adjacent to their vacation home. She sees empty stores. There’s a bar with people inside. She pushes the door open.

INT. FRENCH PUBLIC HOUSE

All of the patrons stop talking and look her way. She quickly retreats and closes the door. Edina considers stealing a baguette from a bicycle outside the shop but is spotted and walks off.

INT. FRENCH VACATION HOME

PATSY: We must be getting closer now.

EDINA: If you get through, I'll ask Saffy to come and bring food, shall I?

PATSY: We don't want her down here. Get her to phone up in French, order the food from Paris and have it sent down.

There is a knock at the door. They whisper and gesture to each other to answer it. Edina relents and goes to answer it. Patsy keeps trying to make a phone call.

PATSY: Oh, one, four?

Edina opens the door and lurches back.

OLD FRENCHMAN: Qu'est-ce que vous faites ici?

EDINA: Pats, Pats! Come here, quickly!

OLD FRENCHMAN: Qu'est-ce que vous faites ici?

PATSY: Oh, God!

OLD FRENCHMAN Le château est à 400 mètres.

PATSY: Phoosh!

EDINA: Err! Ab-ab-ab. See you!

INT. EDINA’S HOLLAND PARK RESIDENCE -- KITCHEN

BUBBLE: Has she rung?

SAFFY: No, what's the matter?

BUBBLE: It's urgent. A very angry man called to say that she's to sign this, or the work won't be finished on doings' flat.

SAFFY: Can't it wait?

BUBBLE: It's cutting it really, really fine if I leave it 'til she gets back. In fact, I think he wants it tomorrow morning. This sort of thing's never happened to me before.

SAFFY: Well, you've never done anything before.

BUBBLE: I know. I don't know why she wants to do this interior design thing. There's just so much work!

MOTHER: Well, she never would be told. She's always had her own ideas about decorating. How she could live in that room of hers at home, I don't know. Since she left, it has had two coats of paint and three different wallpapers, and when the light's right, I can still see Jimi Hendrix's face staring out at me. (Singing) Purple haze, all in my brain. Never the same. Oh, dear

The phone rings. Saffy answers it.

SAFFY: Hello? Mum? No. How can you have malnutrition?

INT. FRENCH VACATION HOME

There is a knock at the door.

EDINA: Oh, God! It's that old man again. You go, Pats, he likes you. He likes you, darling. He fancies you. You go.

PATSY: Thank God! Wine! Eddy, Rosemary's baby has arrived with food!

EDINA: Oh, sweetie! Food, wine! Hurrah! Oh, God! Hello, darling.

Edina grabs the groceries and darts for the kitchen.

SAFFY: It isn’t really what I imagined.

EDINA: Horrible, isn't it?

SAFFY: I like it.

EDINA: It's been a nightmare. Have you eaten?

SAFFY: No.

EDINA: Oh, good. I'll do one of my specials. I'll throw some tomatoes and olive oil and garlic into a pan.

SAFFY: A sandwich would do.

EDINA: No, I'll do my special Come on, can you hand me a frying pan? Saff, give me a little frying pan. Argh!

BUBBLE: Bonjour.

Edina is shocked.

EXT. FRENCH VACATION HOME

SAFFY: Anyone fancy a game of table tennis?

EDINA: I'm sorry there's nothing to do, darling.

SAFFY: What do you mean? There's plenty to do. You could walk, or paint, or play a game of table tennis.

EDINA: I suppose that's alright if you're some deprived kid at its first youth club.

PATSY: Or in prisoner in Cell Block H.

SAFFY: Bubble?

BUBBLE: Oh, yeah! I hope I can remember how to play.

Later, Edina is painting a scene including the others.

EDINA: Shh, shh, shh! Bubble, have you moved? You'll be a bush anyway, I've got my green mixed up. I've done you, Patsy. You can go.

Edina accidentally swallows her paint water.

EXT. EDINA’S FRENCH VACATION HOME

SAFFY: It's lovely here.

EDINA: It's lovely, yes.

SAFFY: How can you not be enjoying it? It's so peaceful and relaxing. Just walking, reading and playing games. It's fun.

EDINA: Fun? Hm. I can see it should be fun, I know it should be fun, sweetie. It's like a secret no one's let me in on.
It's your sort of fun. Mm? Yeah.

SAFFY: Yes. Well, I think I'll go and have a stroll in the village.

EDINA: I won't come.

Edina watches Saffy walk away.

EDINA: Pats!

Rising, Edina heads toward the interior of the vacation home.

EDINA: You know that chateau with the degustation that we passed? What do you think?

INT. NEIGHBORING FRENCH CHATEAU -- WINE CELLAR

EDINA: Mmm Darling, don't snort it. Just drink it, sweetie. Oh! (Choking)

PATSY: Oh Fabulous.

EDINA: Fantastique.

EDINA: Now, which, this one? We've tried this one. I like this one. It's this one This is the one, Pats. This one. This is the one, sweetie.

PATSY: We've tried this one.
EDINA: This one, have you tried this one? : What's this? What's this? We haven't tried this one.
We'll try this one! : This is the one.

No, this is the one.
PATSY: That's the one we like.

EDINA: This is the one we like.
This is the one we didn't want, the empty one.
We didn't want this one, but this is the one This is the one we wanted.
That is the one that we don't want.
Right, this was one, this was one and this was one.
We haven't tried this one.
PATSY: This one. And that box.
EDINA: We're having the box as well, aren't we?

They cackle drunkenly.

EXT: NEIGHBORING FRENCH CHATEAU

Edina and Patsy stagger towards the car holding cases of wine. Edina throws wine bottles and cases into the car and gets in the passenger side.

EDINA: Shit! Someone's taken the steering-wheel!

Patsy collapses on the ground.

EXT. FRENCH VACATION HOME

Edina comes outside with two cups and saucers. She sniffs one and mouths that it's Patsy's. She sits at the table where there is an incomplete puzzle.

PATSY: Thanks, Ed.

EDINA: Right, if you do the sky, I'll do the grass.

PATSY: Alright.

Bubble comes out with table tennis bats.

BUBBLE: Fancy a game of doubles?

EDINA: No, I don't play.

PATSY: I'm only going to play if I can play with Eddy.

EDINA: In a minute. It's so stupid! They've made the holes the wrong shape for the pieces.

INT: FRENCH VACATION HOME

They play table tennis, Edina and Bubble on one side, Saffy and Patsy on the other.

BUBBLE: Come on, Patsy!

EDINA: At least you're not playing with a liquorice all-sort.

SAFFY: She's very good.

EDINA: I'm in the game as well You could hit it to me sometimes.

Some time passes. Patsy re-enters the room with visible powder under a nostril.

EDINA: Pats, Pats. Darling, wipe it, wipe it, wipe it.

Later, the game heats up.

EDINA: Let's stop and think about the rules for a second.

SAFFY: I'll keep score. First service.

EDINA: Hit it to me!

SAFFY: To Bubble.

BUBBLE: No, to me!

SAFFY: Oh, well done! Lovely!

EDINA: Everybody stop it. You're not allowed to play until I'm ready. I want you two to keep an eye on the score. Hand me that ball.

Edina wins a point.

EDINA: Yes!

Later in the evening, they play Monopoly.

BUBBLE: Oh, I'm broke.

PATSY: Take another mortgage. Don't give in.

BUBBLE: What, on a "get out of jail free" card?

EDINA: Well, try.

SAFFY: I thought you were broke. Where did you get all that money from?

PATSY: Don't question me.

SAFFY: Where did you get it?

PATSY: I borrowed it from the bank.

SAFFY: You can't do that. That's cheating!

PATSY: Listen, you little stoat. I own Park Lane. I can borrow as much bloody money as I like. Come on.

EDINA: Honestly, Saffy! Try and get into the spirit of the thing, sweetie.

INT: FRENCH VACATION HOME

The next day, Saffy is packing bags while Edina and Patsy play table tennis in the other room.

SAFFY: Isn't this the paper you wanted my mother to sign?

BUBBLE: Oh, jeepers creepers!

SAFFY: Go and give it to her now. There's still time.

BUBBLE: No.

SAFFY: Go on.

BUBBLE: You.

SAFFY: Don't be silly. Go on!

Bubble begrudingly leaves. Edina and Patsy shriek in unison and run toward the telephone.

EDINA: Get me to that phone! Ingleterra, Ingleterra.
! Jesus! Pronto.

EXT. FRENCH VACATION HOME

Patsy and Bubble take cases to the car.

OLD FRENCHMAN: Qu'est:ce que vous foutez dans cette baraque?

BUBBLE: He says he's wondering why we've been staying at the cottage.

OLD FRENCHMAN: Enfin, le château est à 400 mètres, le personnel vous attend.

BUBBLE: The staff have been expecting us at the chateau half a mile down the road.

OLD FRESHMAN: J'espère que vous passerez de bonnes vacances, va.

BUBBLE: Aww. He hopes we had a pleasant stay.

PATSY: Listen, you little gonk. If you tell anyone what he said, I'll kill you.

Edina and Saffy run out.

EDINA: Drive, just drive! Get in the car, get in the car! Drive, drive! (honks the horn frantically) Patsy, get in! (Bubble tarries.) Leave her, leave her. She's not quick enough. Come on, sweetie!

INT. CUSTOMS CHECKPOINT -- UK INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

PATSY: It's absolutely ridiculous stopping me. Look at the people they're letting through. Stoned Chinese hippies with backpacks, for God's sake!

Customs Officer points out pills in Patsy’s luggage.

PATSY : Prescription!

EDINA: There is someone waiting just out by that barrier there to get this piece of paper to save my reputation and career. (Whispering to Patsy) If he finds anything, Pats, you're on your own.

CUSTOMS OFFICER: Whose bag is this?

EDINA: This is my case. It's not my sponge bag.

CUSTOMS OFFICER: Who packed this case?

EDINA & PATSY: They did.

CUSTOMS OFFICER: You'd better come with me.

INT. CUSTOMS HOLDING TANK -- UK INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

Edina is in a foul mood.

EDINA: *You* don't have to say anything.

SAFFY: I know!

EDINA :If you had given me this paper sooner, I would have rushed home and I wouldn't be standing here now!

SAFFY: It's not her fault we're here now.

EDINA: I don't think anyone quite appreciates the scale of what is happening here! It means that of course Bettina's apartment won't get decorated. It's the end of my career in interior design before it's even begun.

SAFFY: Buildings everywhere might heave a sigh of relief.

EDINA: I don't know why I don't sack you.

Bubble bursts into tears.

SAFFY: Don't be silly. Where else are you going to find someone who makes doing nothing into an art form? I'm sorry. I had to say that.

BUBBLE: It's alright. I didn't quite understand what you meant.

PATSY: Is no one going to speak to me?

EDINA: Shh!

PATSY: After all, I'll be the one who'll be going to prison.

BUBBLE: At least you've got your table tennis practice in.

Customs Officer enters room.

PATSY: I must be allowed that telephone call before my freedom is finally snatched away from me.

CUSTOMS OFFICER: That won't be necessary. The powder we found was a perfectly harmless, innocent substance.

EDINA: Oh!

CUSTOMS OFFICER: You're all free to go.

PATSY: I beg your pardon?

CUSTOMS OFFICER: You're free to go. Be a bit more careful next time.

PATSY: Just hang on there. I demand that you retest it. Come back! I paid a huge amount of money for that stuff. Don't tell me it was talcum powder.

End credits play.

EDINA: So you've been diddled. It's happened to us all.

PATSY: But it's not the money.

EDINA: What is it?

PATSY: It's the horrible realisation that I must have enjoyed playing ping-pong.

EDINA: Sweetie! Oh, darling! Oh, God, sweetie! What a day! What a day I've had, sweetie, darling, darling, darling! I have been at work since I left here this morning!

SAFFY: Do you want some lunch?

EDINA: No, I had lunch in the studio. Studio, sweetie, studio. Studio, darling. Action, lights, camera.

SAFFY: What have you been doing?

EDINA: Pop-Specs ad.

SAFFY: What?

EDINA: You know I represent Pop-Specs darling? We're doing a new ad. We're up marketing the image.

SAFFY: What are Pop-Specs?

EDINA: What are Pop-Specs! Are you dead? Are you dead? These are them! These are them! Look, darling. These are Pop-Specs! They are great. Look. Do you see that one? Here's another one, darling. Schizophrenia! They're fantastic!

SAFFY: How can you up market those?

EDINA: Well Patsy's agreed to put them in a photo shoot in her magazine. And there's a new ad darling. New ad, sweetie, which is mainly my idea. My original idea. It's very clever. God! It better bloody work otherwise my company is gonna be left with one minor department store, two student designers, Smudgibars and Lulu paying for your upkeep, darling. And Lulu is like that, sweetie. You could show a little enthusiasm, you know.

SAFFY: Mum, why should I be happy that you're going to spend thousands of pounds on...

EDINA: Hundreds of thousands of pounds.

SAFFY: ...persuading people to buy some cheap bit of plastic junk that they don't even want?

EDINA: Don't know they want yet... sweetie.

SAFFY: ...That will then be thrown away after a couple of months once the novelty wears off and sit around polluting the planet.

EDINA: That's it, is it? That's it, is it? Can I show you, can I show you something, sweetie? Can I show you something on this? Look at that.

[Eddy points to "Pop-specs" bag] 

EDINA: What do you think that is, there? What is that?

SAFFY: It's a sticker with a green tree on it.

EDINA: Yes.

SAFFY: What does that mean?

EDINA: Kind to trees, sweetie.

SAFFY: How are they kind to trees?

EDINA: Well, they ain't made of wood. How kind do you want them to be?

SAFFY: Come on. Wake up!

EDINA: Oh, God! Did I fall asleep here? Oh, damn. Wake up, Pats! Wake up, darling. Let's catch up on a bit of luxury, sweetie. Oh! I'm going to have some breakfast and sit by the pool or something.

SAFFY: We've got to go, it's Friday.

PATSY: Friday?

SAFFY: You've been unconscious for three days.

EDINA, PATSY: No!

EDINA: What's that smell? What's that smell? Is that you, sweetie? That sort of honey, yoghurty smell? Is that you?

EDINA: I'm not like Saffy, I can't walk around looking like a...

PATSY: ...A stale old piece of toast.

EDINA: Exactly. It takes more than a cold flannel and some Body Shop oatmeal scrub for me, you know. And I can't meet clients smelling like an old bowl of porridge, can I, sweetie? These are valid business expenses.

JUDGE: ...driving without a license, driving without insurance, not wearing a seatbelt, having no tax disc displayed, driving over the legal speed limit, driving under the influence of alcohol, allowing another person to drive your vehicle under the influence of alcohol. In the region of £5,000 of parking fees owing, £6,000 of damage to property. Charges of assault and abuse - the charges of attempted murder and robbery have been dropped. Shoplifting...

PATSY: My name is Patsy Stone. I'm an alcoholic, and what she did was an act of humanitarian mercy.

JUDGE: That is hardly a reason to steal a crate of champagne.

EDINA: Have you any idea how much champagne costs these days? I was forced to steal it. My daughter wouldn't have allowed me to buy it.

JUDGE: I must ask you to sit down as stop wasting the court's time. The sum of £50,000 is to be paid by you in damages, and a further fine of £2,000. You will also be liable for all cost incurred.

EDINA: Well, getting rid of my chauffeur was a little bit of a falso economy, wasn't it sweetie?

JUDGE: ...and a lifetime ban on driving. And, finally, Mrs. Monsoon...

EDINA: Can I just say one word in my defense, um?

SAFFY: I don't think that's a very good idea, Mum. Your mouth is working for the prosecution.

EDINA: Oh, darling, this is what I do well, sweetie. You might pick up a few tips for the Debating Society, you never know. Without notes, Saff.

[Gran claps]

EDINA: Thank you, thank you.

[to judge]

EDINA: Right - I, the proposed accused, think that, well, I mean, you know, well the day in question was not a good day for me, all right? But I put it to you that I don't see how any day could have been good the way this bloody country's run. Well, you know, I was just trying to do my best, trying to get from A to B, do a little shopping. I was trying to take control of my life, you know, only to find that it's actually controlled for me by petty bureaucracy and bits of bloody paper - ignorant bloody petty rules and laws that just obstruct every tiny little action until you've committed a crime without even knowing it! I mean, you know, why can't life just be made a little easier for everybody, eh? Why can't it be more like the Continent, and then run down the street in front of charging bulls whilst letting fireworks off out of his bloody nostrils without anyone blinking an eye? Uh? Because it's probably a local holiday and nobody's at work because they all want to have just a little bit of fun and they're not intimidated by some outdated work ethic. I mean, there has to be more to life than just being safe...

JUDGE: Is there a point to all of this?

EDINA: Yes, Yes!... Why, oh why, do we pay taxes, hmmm? I mean, just to have bloody parking restrictions- and BUGGERY-UGLY traffic wardens, and BOLLOCKY-pedestrian-BLOODY-crossings?... and those BASTARD railings outside shops windows, making it so difficult, so you can't even get in them! I mean, I know they're there to stop stupid people running into the street and killing themselves! But we're not all stupid! We don't all need nurse-maiding. I mean, why not just have a Stupidity Tax? Just tax the stupid people!

PATSY: And let them DIE!

EDINA: Yes!

JUDGE: Anymore of this ridiculous rant, and I'll put you both away!

GRAN: Hear, hear!

JUDGE: Edina Margaret Rose Monsoon, I hereby sentence you to...

PATSY: LIGHT! LIGHT! LIGHT!

EDINA: Oh no Pats, not another no-smoking cab. They must see you coming these days.

PATSY: Bloody bastard asthmatic cab driver!

EDINA: They're actually, most of these seem alright darling. They're leaching something out of your skin rather than the other way around.

SAFFY: She's probably recharging them.

PATSY: Careful Eddie. Don't rip so hard.

SAFFY: Yes, be careful. At her age the flesh slides off the bone like a well-cooked chicken.

EDINA: For your information, there are some people who'd pay a lot of money for Patsy's body.

SAFFY: Morticians. How much do you think you'd get for a ready-embalmed carcass? No wonder she's always been refused a donor card.

EDINA: Whose side are you on? Do you want us to be poor?

PATSY: You'll be poor...?

SAFFY: That's got you worried.

PATSY: Eddie, we simply cannot allow them to cut us off like this. Now, listen, sweetie, it is not alimony, it is compensation.

SAFFY: For what?

EDINA: It's damages, sweetie, for those long crippling hours of painful labour I went through on your behalf.

SAFFY: You had a Caesarean.

EDINA: Yes, I know I had a Caesarean, darling but... how do you think it feels to wake up every morning and look down and see your stomach still smiling back up at her, hmm? You can't put a price on that!

EDINA: Bubble! Wake up, Bubble! Come on! Wake up, darling! Oh, it's like tea-break on the Thunderbirds set. Somebody operate her, please!
